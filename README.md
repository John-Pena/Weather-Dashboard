## Description of Project

This repository was a challenge to test my knowledge on using APIs and incorporating them into my webpage to add a more dynamic interface for users. I created a dashboard that would pull the users' requested city and display the weather (desription of the day with an icon, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and uv index). Additionally, I created a location for a five day forecast to display weather for future dates in the case they would be in the requested city for a period of time.

## Known Bugs
